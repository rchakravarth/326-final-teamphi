Project name: food4umass (Heroku link: https://food4umass.herokuapp.com/)

Semester: Fall 2021

Project overview:

The app that we built is a simple meal plan builder that implements two features: the first is a budget 
estimator based on one serving size, with 5 different categories of food to pick from. Additionally,
there is an option for the user to show the macronutrient profile with the individual grams of carbs,
fats, and protein in a meal as well as the total calories. Lastly, there is a "save meal" button that will
save the current meal to the user's profile. This app separates itself from some of the other meal planning 
applications that are out there as it includes a budget based on the serving size to give an estimated cost
per meal.

User Interface:

Above is the log-in screen. Before users are able to log in, they need to register for an account on the page below.

Once the user has either registered or signed in with an existing account, they will see the main page where our 
user interactivity will happen on. The user can select different foods per category and it will tally up the cost of 
everything the user selects. They also have the option to show macronutrient profile in grams as well as total calories of
their selections. The plan was also to save the meals
