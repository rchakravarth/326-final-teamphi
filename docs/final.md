Project name: food4umass

Semester: Fall 2021

Project overview:

The app that we built is a simple meal plan builder that implements two features: the first is a budget 
estimator based on one serving size, with 5 different categories of food to pick from. Additionally,
there is an option for the user to show the macronutrient profile with the individual grams of carbs,
fats, and protein in a meal as well as the total calories. Lastly, there is a "save meal" button that will
save the current meal to the user's profile.
