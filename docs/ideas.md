TEAM PHI

Application Name: Meals For U(mass) 

Group Overview

Members: Rishab Chakravarthy, Kenny Duong, Zach Reynolds 

Github IDs: rchakravarth, kennyvduong, ztreynolds   

Idea overview: Our group's idea was to create a web application that would assist in the creation of meal plans based on 
certain parameters that the student would give. Typically, most meal plan applications do not have the options of pricing
based on budgets or the ability to track macronutrient profiles of food, so this is something we would like to include
in our website.

Features: The users have the ability to sign in with a user profile they can create, and throughout the site there will be 
interactive scrolling, text inputs where users can give parameters for their meals such as budget, where we can find a way
to craft something affordable that is well balanced based on the user's parameters.
