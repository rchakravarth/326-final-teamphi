This is the wireframe that Rishab created, there are some tweaks to be made such as
more buttons to save meals to profile for example, menu buttons for navigation, etc.

HTML file: Sign in page (Kenny Duong)

I create the sign in page for the program.  Everything is currently programmed in the html file without the css file.  

Eventually I would create an button such as "remember password" and have it running with scripts. Create an account would be implicated in another way but run similiarly to the sign in.
