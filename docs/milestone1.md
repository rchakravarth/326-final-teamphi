**Pt 0. Data Interactions:**

Users are going to be able to first sign into a profile or create a username + password if they have not done so already. 
Then, they will proceed to the main page where they are able to select different foods using a drop-down menu based on the
type of food, such as protein, carbs, vegetables, condiments or seasonings/additional addons. This is then put in a text field
where the approximate price of the products will be calculated. We are still figuring out if we can pull price data directly 
from a grocery store or some other database so that it can dynamically update it. Users will then be able to save these meals
to their profile and access them later, and they will also have the option to enable macronutrient profiles as well for those 
who are interested in tracking calories.


**Pt. 1 Wireframe:**

This is the wireframe that Rishab created, there are some tweaks to be made such as
more buttons to save meals to profile for example, menu buttons for navigation, etc.

**Pt. 2 HTML/CSS:**

HTML and CSS files (Kenny Duong)
I create the sign in page for the program (10-22). Eventually I would create an button such as "remember password" and have it running with scripts. Create an account would be implicated in another way but run similiarly to the sign in. I also created the choices of food items (10-23). There will be more fixes and tweaks to be made but for now it has the selector. Rishab was able to adjust the background of the sign in page as well as separate any inline CSS in the sign in HTML code and put it in a separate file (10/22). Rishab also worked on the meal_builder.html file by dividing up the format into 3 columns like shown in the wireframe using Bootstrap's Grid Layout and creating fields for adding protein, carbs and fats by grams for those who want to track macros. (10/23). Zach assisted with working on the columns and buttons apart of the meal_builder.html.
