Pt. 1 Wireframe:

https://whimsical.com/cs326-project-XVWEybMKMYuaFinxapTdAC

This is the wireframe that Rishab created, there are some tweaks to be made such as
more buttons to save meals to profile for example, menu buttons for navigation, etc.

HTML files (Kenny Duong)

I create the sign in page for the program. (10-22)

Eventually I would create an button such as "remember password" and have it running with scripts. Create an account would be implicated in another way but run similiarly to the sign in. 

I also created the choices of food items (10-23)

There will be more fixes and tweaks to be made but for now it has the selector.
